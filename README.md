# Integrating-Omics-Data-in-Medical-Records

### How to cite:

## Background
 Omics data provide a comprehensive amount of molecular profiles from biological samples (e.g. [Genomics](https://www.nature.com/subjects/genomics), [Epigenomics](https://www.nature.com/subjects/epigenomics), [Transcriptomics](https://www.nature.com/subjects/transcriptomics), [Proteomics](https://www.nature.com/subjects/proteomics), [Metabolomics](https://www.nature.com/subjects/metabolomics) …). EHR or electronic health records are digital records of health information alongside personal information (age, ethnicity, gender, …).

 ## What is the problem ? 
As omics technologies become more widely used in the clinical environment, integrating omics data within EHRs will become increasingly important for interpretation and clinical decision support. 
However, it has been a challenge to both add the omics data into the EHRs, due to their size and complexity and provide easily interpretable results that could be used by clinicians.

## Why fix it ?
Integrative multi-omic data analysis is of growing importance because it provides a holistic view of molecular fingerprints for each patient’s condition.

This project aims to provide an easily manageable database to store both patient’s EHRs and -omics data and provide clinicians with readable and easily interpretable output that helps them in the process of decision taking.

### Case study
As a start, and due to time constraint, we will be focusing on integrating transcriptomic data first into our project.
